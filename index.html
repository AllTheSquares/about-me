    <p class ="about-site">How about I introduce myself? My name is Ryan. I'm fourteen. I live in a small town in New Jersey and am soon to begin high school. I like learning about computers and try to pursue other passions. If your're reading (or hearing) this right now, you're probably alive and breathing. As a pass-time, I do like playing some games (my GitHub username is the name I use in other platforms). I think that is it.</p>
